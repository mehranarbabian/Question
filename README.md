In this simple project, I tried to answer the question of how much student's grades differ when they have limited time for the exam compared to their previous exam grades in the same subject. Overall, student's grades were still very similar to their previous exam scores, but two approaches were present here: one group of students who studied more, and another group who practiced more sample questions. The results showed that students who studied more achieved higher grades.
